* Things to tweak after first iteration (May 2016)

  - Add a card with info like my name, the web address
  - underline primes?
  - saturate colors
  - choose other colors
  - prime circles have shapes in them for ones digit
  - special case for 3 with dots, smaller dots around triangle (so no
    overlap) --- does this need to extend to other cases?  triangle
    with pairs (i.e. 6)?
